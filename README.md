Hongdown
========

Hongdown is a Markdown formatter that enforces Hong Minhee's Markdown style
conventions.  The formatter is implemented in Rust using the [comrak] library
for parsing.  It produces consistently formatted Markdown output following
a distinctive style used across multiple projects including [Fedify], [Hollo],
and [Vertana].

The name *Hongdown* is a portmanteau of *Hong* (from Hong Minhee, the author)
and *Markdown*.  It also sounds like the Korean word *hongdapda* (홍답다),
meaning "befitting of Hong" or "Hong-like."
