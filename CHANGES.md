Hongdown changelog
==================

Version 0.2.0
-------------

To be released.

 -  Fixed text wrapping to use Unicode display width instead of byte length.
    East Asian wide characters (Korean, Japanese, Chinese) are now correctly
    counted as 2 columns, so text wraps at the correct visual position.
    [[#3] by Lee Dogeon]

 -  Added support for directory arguments.  When a directory is passed as an
    argument, Hongdown now recursively finds all Markdown files (_\*.md_ and
    _\*.markdown_) within it.  [[#2]]
